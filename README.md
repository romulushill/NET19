## Brief

NET 19 is a neural network developed to make future predictions from a designated dataset.
The neural network makes use of adaptive intelligence, also known as machine learning, to improve the accuracy of the model in real time.

## Weightings
The weightings the network operates on are designated into 2 sections.
The network uses "Categories" for predictions. Each category has a designated weighting value. Within each category there are predefined "solutions". Each solution also has a designated weighting.
The weighting of a category should be a decimal value < 1. The sum of all category weightings is == 1. The value for each category weighting is defined by the adaptive intelligence from the solutions within.
Likewise the weighting of a category solution should be a decimal value < 1. The sum of all solutions weightings within a category  == 1. The value of any category solution weighting is defined by adaptive intelligence.

## Calculation
When calculating the percentage chance, the magnitude of the category weighting is determined by the selected solution's weighting.
E.g, a solution weighting of 0.3 means that the category weighting used in final calculation is only 30% of the total value.
